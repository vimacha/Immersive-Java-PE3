Q1: Consider the Following Problem: You need to create a Java class that accepts an integer array. The class should:

Loop through the array, and for each element, prints to the console whether the number is even or odd.
Loop through the array, and remove all prime numbers.
Reverse the elements of the array. You need to:
Write the Test Scenarios in Given-Should Format in the README.md under the Header
PE <pe_number> Problem <prob_number>
Ensure you create scenarios for: a. One or more Positive Test Case b. One or More Negative Test Cases c. One or More Edge Cases

Implement the Test Cases
Write the implementation code
Q2: Consider the Following Problem: You need to create a Java class that accepts two arrays of String objects, array1 and array2.

Compare the elements of both the arrays
Loop through each array, to remove any duplicate elements.
Append the first element of array1 to array2.
Prepend the mid element of array2 to array1. You need to:
Write the Test Scenarios in Given-Should Format in the README.md under the Header
PE <pe_number> Problem <prob_number>
Ensure you create scenarios for: a. One or more Positive Test Case b. One or More Negative Test Cases c. One or More Edge Cases 2. Implement the Test Cases 3. Write the implementation code

Q3. Create a class called StudentMarks, which prompts user for the number of students, reads it from the keyboard, and saves it in an int variable called numOfStudents. It then prompts user for the grades of each of the students and saves them in an int array called stuGrades. Your program shall check that the grade is between 0 and 100 else has to throw an error message.

Place Name without Vowels:2 Grmny Place Name without Vowels:3 Egypt Place Name without Vowels:4 czchslvk

Q5. Write a program to find out if a series of 7 digits are consecutive numbers. To make this easier,assume the digits are a string and use split() Input: 98,96,95,94,93 Output: 98,96,95,94,93 non consecutive numbers Input: 54,53,52,51,50,49,48 Output : 54,53,52,51,50,49,48 are consecutive numbers Input: 1,2,3,4,5,6,6 Output: 1,2,3,4,5,6,6 non consecutive numbers

Q6. Write a program that will generate exceptions of type NegativeArraySizeException, IndexOutOfBoundsException, NullPointerException. Record the catching of each exception by displaying the message stored in the exception object.
